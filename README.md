# Abstract

**Background:** Clinical manifestation of atherogenic cardiovascular disease is considered to differ between men and women. The anatomy and physiology of cardiac pain have not been properly characterized with respect to sex-related differences in humans.
**Objective:** To investigate the relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) risk and pain localizations in both sexes.
**Methods:** We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) on summary-level data from sex-stratified genome-wide association studies of CAD as well as chest, neck and shoulder, back, and facial pain using the UK Biobank. We identified 32 and 19 instrumental variables associated with CAD for both sexes, respectively. 
**Results:** Genetically-influenced CAD associated with increased risk of self-reported chest pain in men (OR: 1.33, CI: 1.25 – 1.41) and women (OR: 1.44, CI: 1.20 – 1.73) as well for clinical chest pain (men OR: 1.22, CI: 1.17 — 1.26; women OR: 1.31, CI: 1.18 — 1.46). CAD was associated with back pain in women only (OR: 1.35, CI: 1.03 — 1.66) compared to men (p-value for interaction: 0.036). Neck and shoulder pain trended towards a difference between men (OR: 0.97, CI: 0.87 — 1.08) and women (OR: 1.22, CI: 0.91 — 1.63) (p-value for interaction: 0.051). Sensitivity analysis did not indicate results were biased by directional pleiotropy.
**Conclusions:** We showed CAD drives different pain manifestations in men and women. Current efforts suggested cardiac pain is not majorly limited to the chest but is also referred to other regions in women at the population level. Future research is required to identify what causes these differences at multiple levels of research.
